# Wiki Knights is getting a new website!

We are excited to announce that we are in the process of developing a **brand new** website for Wiki Knights! 🚀✨  
Our current site has served us well, but we believe it's time for a fresh look and improved functionality to  
better serve our community. 🌟

We are first migrating the site from a Wordpress site to a static site generator 🛠️💻, which will allow us to cut down on server costs 💸 and improve site speed ⚡.

After this process is complete, we will be working on a new design and layout for the site 🎨🖥️. We want to make sure that the new website is user-friendly 🤝, visually appealing 👀, and easy to navigate 🧭. We will be incorporating feedback from our community 🗣️ to ensure that the new site meets the needs of our users to accurately reflect our club. We are also planning to expand on the blog 📝 and resource library 📚.

We will be sharing updates on our progress 📢 and will be seeking feedback from our community 🗣️ throughout the development process. We are committed to creating a website that reflects the values and mission of Wiki Knights 🛡️, and we can't wait to share it with you all. Stay tuned for more updates! 🔔

If you have any suggestions 💡 or ideas 💭 for the new website or would like to contribute 🤝, please feel free to reach out to us 📬. We would love to hear from you! 🗣️
